The coconut nut is a giant nut
If you eat too much, you'll get very fat
Now, the coconut nut is a big, big nut
But this delicious nut is not a nut
It's the coco fruit (it's the coco fruit)
Of the coco tree (of the coco tree)
From the coco palm family
There are so many uses of the coconut tree
You can build a big house for the family
All you need is to find a coconut man
If he cuts the tree, he gets the fruit free
It's the coco fruit (it's the coco fruit)
Of the coco tree (of the coco tree)
From the coco palm family
The coconut bark for the kitchen floor
If you save some of it, you can build a door
Now, the coconut trunk, do not throw this junk
If you save some of it, you'll have the second floor
The coconut wood is very good
It can stand 20 years if you pray it would
Now, the coconut root, to tell you the truth
You can throw it or use it as firewood
